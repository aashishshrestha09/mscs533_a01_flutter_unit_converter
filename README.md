# Measures Converter App

[![Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-3.0%2B-blue?logo=flutter)](https://flutter.dev/)

A Flutter application for converting between metric and imperial units (e.g., miles to kilometers, kilograms to pounds).

## Overview

This app allows users to:

- Select a measure category (Length, Weight, Temperature)
- Choose source and target units (e.g., Miles â†’ Kilometers)
- Enter a value and convert it
- See the result only after pressing the **Convert** button

## Key Features

- Intuitive, modern UI
- Clear separation of logic and UI (industry best practice)
- Well-commented, readable code
- Follows Dart/Flutter naming conventions and standards
- Error handling for invalid input
- Unit tests for conversion logic and validation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aashishshrestha09/mscs533_a01_flutter_unit_converter.git
   cd mscs533_a01_flutter_unit_converter
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

### Run the App

Start the app on your emulator or device:

```sh
flutter run
```

### Run Unit Tests

To run all unit tests:

```sh
flutter test
```

## UI

- Clean, modern Material Design
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Category and unit selection with dropdowns and chips
- Error messages for invalid input
- Result card for conversion output

## Code Quality & Best Practices

- All major classes, methods, and widgets are documented with DartDoc comments (`///`)
- Variables and methods use descriptive, consistent names
- UI and business logic are separated for maintainability
- Error handling is implemented for invalid input
- Follows [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)

## Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns:** The app separates UI (widgets), business logic (services), and data (models/data).
- **Feature-based Structure:** Each feature (conversion, theming, etc.) has its own folder.
- **Reusable Widgets:** UI components are modular and reusable.
- **Unit Testing:** Core logic is covered by unit tests for reliability.

      <td><img src="screenshots/temperature_conversion.png" alt="Temperature" width="220"/></td>
   </tr>

## Limitations & Future Work

- More unit categories (e.g., volume, area)
- Localization for multiple languages
- Dark mode support
